## Description
The aim of this case study is to utilize data to understand customer churn and identify key factors that lead to customer attrition. The main task here is to build machine learning models that can **predict whether a customer is likely to churn** based on the provided data.

## Motivation
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, and understanding the factors that contribute to it can help businesses retain their customers, reduce costs, and increase revenue. By analyzing customer behavior and identifying key indicators of churn, businesses can take proactive measures to prevent it.

## Task
The task of this case study is to build machine learning models that can predict customer churn based on the provided data. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company or ceases their subscription. We will start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data, detect patterns, and identify potential outliers. We will then preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Next, we will build several machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and artificial neural network, to predict customer churn. We will evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.

Finally, we will identify the important features that contribute to customer churn and provide insights and recommendations to mitigate customer churn.
