## Description
The objective of this case study is to **optimize a search engine and email 
outreach system** by building and evaluating various algorithms and machine 
learning models. The aim is to improve the current search ranking so that 
the outreach emails are prioritized to people who are most likely to respond 
positively.

## Data
Dataset contains expert profiles from all around the world, which includes 
important information such as email domains and country of residence. For each 
client project, a company searches for suitable experts and sends outreach 
emails to them. The order of the experts appearing in the search and whether 
they responded to each outreach email is recorded.

The csv file contains data that will be used for training and testing machine 
learning models. It includes a unique ID of a single person, when the search 
was performed, a unique ID of a single search for a particular project, the 
rank of the person in the search result, the domicile country-codes of the 
person, the email domains of the person, and whether the outreach was 
successful or not.

## Task
The task is to analyze and prepare this data and propose approaches or models that could be investigated to re-rank the profiles so that the top experts have the highest probability of responding positively. An analysis and interpretation of the results is provided. 
This includes evaluating the performance of the models, determining which model 
is better, and identifying which features are good indicators for the target.
