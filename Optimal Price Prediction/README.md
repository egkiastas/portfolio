## Description
The goal of this task is to **find the optimal price to sell an item** based on various factors. These factors include the product variation ID, sale price, quantity, and day. In order to achieve this goal, we can either suggest price optimization or quantity optimization. The aim is to maximize revenue per product by determining the ideal price point that will result in the greatest profit.

## Motivation
Pricing is a critical component of any business, and pricing optimization is essential to maximize profits. Understanding how different factors affect sales and revenue can help businesses determine the optimal price for their products. By analyzing the data, we can identify the most significant factors that affect sales and determine how to price the products to increase revenue.

## Data
The data provided for this task include information about the product variation ID, sale price, quantity, and day. Each row represents an individual sale and includes the relevant information for that transaction.

- productvariationid: a unique identifier for each product variation
- saleprice: the price at which the product was sold
- quantity: the number of items sold
- day: the day of the sale

## Task
The main objective of this task is to find the optimal price point that will result in the highest revenue per product. We can achieve this by suggesting either price optimization or quantity optimization. Price optimization involves determining the ideal price that will maximize revenue, while quantity optimization involves identifying the optimal quantity of items to sell at a given price to maximize revenue.

To achieve our goal, we will need to analyze the data and identify the factors that most strongly influence sales. We can use this information to develop pricing strategies that will maximize revenue for the business. Ultimately, our analysis and recommendations will help businesses make data-driven decisions about pricing and improve their bottom line.
