Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Notebook Repository! This 
repository contains a collection of uses cases that showcase my 
exploration and problem-solving skills in the field of data science.

## Projects
Here's a brief overview of the folders in this repository:

- User Monetization: Process of building classification models that can predict whether a user will buy a subscription.
- Optimal Price Prediction: Find the optimal price to sell an item based on various factors.
