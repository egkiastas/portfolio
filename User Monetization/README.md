## Description
The aim of this case study is to utilize data to understand what factors drive users 
to purchase subscriptions on a website. The main task here is to build 
classification models that can **predict whether a user will buy a subscription** 
based on the provided data.

## Motivation
Optimization is a key factor in any business, and analysis of monetization is 
one of the tools used to achieve this goal. Understanding which factors influence 
subscription purchases, such as the features developed, specific user 
behavior, or user characteristics, can help with marketing, enhancing user 
experience, and optimizing revenue.

- subscription: a binary column indicating whether the user bought a subscription 
(1) or not (0)
- Anonymized numerical columns scaled to range (0, 1) (users' actions)
- Anonymized binary columns with values 0 or 1 (users' actions)

## Task

the performance of the models, determining which model is better, and 
identifying which features are good indicators for the target.
